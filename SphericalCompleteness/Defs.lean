A `PseudoMetricSpace` is *spherically complete* if every nested (antitone) sequence
of closed balls has nonempty intersection.

More precisely, given centers `ci : ℕ → α` and radii `ri : ℕ → NNReal`, if the family
of closed balls `i ↦ closedBall (ci i) (ri i)` is antitone with respect to inclusion
(i.e. the balls are decreasing as `i` increases), then the intersection
`⋂ i, closedBall (ci i) (ri i)` is nonempty.

This is a standard completeness-type axiom used in non-Archimedean/ultrametric settings,
but it is stated here for general pseudo-metric spaces.

Builds a `CompleteSpace` instance from a `SphericallyCompleteSpace`.

In a `PseudoMetricSpace`, completeness can be characterized by the property that every
antitone (nested) family of closed balls whose radii tend to `0` has a nonempty intersection.
A spherically complete space provides exactly this nonempty-intersection property for nested
balls, so we can rewrite completeness using
`completeSpace_iff_nonempty_iInter_closedBall_of_tendsto_zero` and discharge the
resulting goal via `SphericallyCompleteSpace.isSphericallyComplete`.

This instance is useful for transferring results stated for `CompleteSpace` to contexts where
spherical completeness is assumed.

Constructs a `SphericallyCompleteSpace` instance from `ProperSpace`.

In a proper pseudo-metric space, every closed ball is compact. This lemma uses that fact
to show spherical completeness: given a sequence of closed balls
`closedBall (ci i) (ri i)` that is antitone under inclusion (the `hanti` hypothesis),
the intersection of all these balls is nonempty.

The proof applies
`IsCompact.nonempty_iInter_of_sequence_nonempty_isCompact_isClosed` to the family of
closed balls, using:
* `hanti` to provide the monotonicity (nestedness) condition,
* `nonempty_closedBall` (from `ri i` being nonnegative) for each ball’s nonemptiness,
* `isCompact_closedBall` (from `ProperSpace`) for compactness of an initial ball,
* `isClosed_closedBall` for closedness of each ball.

Transport spherical completeness across an isometric equivalence.

Given pseudo-metric spaces `E` and `F`, an instance `[SphericallyCompleteSpace E]`,
and an isometry equivalence `f : E ≃ᵢ F`, this constructs `SphericallyCompleteSpace F`.

The proof pulls back any antitone family of closed balls in `F` along `f.symm` to an
antitone family of closed balls in `E`, uses spherical completeness of `E` to obtain a
point in the intersection, and then maps that point forward by `f`. Membership in each
ball is preserved because `f` is an isometry.

This is the standard “property invariant under isometric equivalence” argument.

Constructs a `SphericallyCompleteSpace` instance for a type `α` under the assumptions that `α` is a
`NontriviallyNormedField` and a `WeaklyLocallyCompactSpace`.

The proof proceeds by first obtaining a `ProperSpace α` instance via
`ProperSpace.of_nontriviallyNormedField_of_weaklyLocallyCompactSpace`, and then letting typeclass
resolution infer `SphericallyCompleteSpace α` from `ProperSpace α`.
